# traffic_sign_classifier
I understand that you don't want Jupyter notebooks, but most of my experience coding was doing date science projects and it was more convenient to use Jupiter notebooks. As for other projects not in Jupyter notebooks they were school assignments and doing leetcode which don't represent my coding abilities fully also they are in c/c++/Matlab so not the programming language I want to use in the intership so I hope you will understand. 

this a neural network model that calssifies 43 different traffic signs
